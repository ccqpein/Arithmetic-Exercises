[source](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/description/)

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of the **same length**.

A **concatenated string** is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

+ For example, if `words = ["ab","cd","ef"]`, then "`abcdef`", "`abefcd`", "`cdabef`", "`cdefab`", "`efabcd`", and "`efcdab`" are all concatenated strings. "`acdbef`" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.
Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]

Output: [0,9]

Explanation:

The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]

Output: []

Explanation:

There is no concatenated substring.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]

Output: [6,9,12]

Explanation:

The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"].
The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"].
The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"].
```

**Constraints:**

+ `1 <= s.length <= 104`
+ `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
+ `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
+ `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
