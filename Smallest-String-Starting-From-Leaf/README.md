Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node has a value from `0` to `25` representing the letters `'a'` to `'z'`: a value of `0` represents `'a'`, a value of `1` represents `'b'`, and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, "`ab`" is lexicographically smaller than "`aba`".  A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)

Note:

1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 8500.
2. Each node in the tree will have a value between 0 and 25.
