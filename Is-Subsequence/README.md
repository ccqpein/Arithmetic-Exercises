Given two strings `s` and `t`, check if `s` is a **subsequence** of `t`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "`ace`" is a subsequence of "`abcde`" while "`aec`" is not).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

+ `0 <= s.length <= 100`
+ `0 <= t.length <= 104`
+ `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
