Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Note:**
The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 10^4
Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 10^4
