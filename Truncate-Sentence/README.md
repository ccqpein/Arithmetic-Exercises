A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).


	+ For example, `&quot;Hello World&quot;`, `&quot;HELLO&quot;`, and `&quot;hello world hello world&quot;` are all sentences.


You are given a sentence `s`​​​​​​ and an integer `k`​​​​​​. You want to **truncate** `s`​​​​​​ such that it contains only the **first** `k`​​​​​​ words. Return `s`​​​​*​​ after **truncating** it.*


**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = &quot;Hello how are you Contestant&quot;, k = 4
**Output:** &quot;Hello how are you&quot;
**Explanation:**
The words in s are [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;how&quot; &quot;are&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;Contestant&quot;].
The first 4 words are [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;how&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;you&quot;].
Hence, you should return &quot;Hello how are you&quot;.

```


**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = &quot;What is the solution to this problem&quot;, k = 4
**Output:** &quot;What is the solution&quot;
**Explanation:**
The words in s are [&quot;What&quot;, &quot;is&quot; &quot;the&quot;, &quot;solution&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;this&quot;, &quot;problem&quot;].
The first 4 words are [&quot;What&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;solution&quot;].
Hence, you should return &quot;What is the solution&quot;.
```


**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = &quot;chopper is not a tanuki&quot;, k = 5
**Output:** &quot;chopper is not a tanuki&quot;

```



**Constraints:**


	+ `1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 500`
	+ `k` is in the range `[1, the number of words in s]`.
	+ `s` consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
	+ The words in `s` are separated by a single space.
	+ There are no leading or trailing spaces.
